        Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
        Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
        Simple is better than complex.<br>
        Complex is better than complicated.<br>
        Flat is better than nested.<br>
        Sparse is better than dense.<br>
        Readability counts.<br>
        Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
        Although practicality beats purity.<br>
        Errors should never pass silently.<br>
        Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
        In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
        There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
        Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
        Now is better than never.<br>
        Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
        If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
        If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
        Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br>
